# simplified_galaxy_model

This is a simplified galaxy model created together with my team for the summer project.
The code used leap-frog method to calculate the velocity and position of the particles after certain time duration.
The initial condition is set to be spiral shape, as it is difficult for us at that time to introduce a random initial condition.
