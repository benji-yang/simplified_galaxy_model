# simplified_galaxy_model

This is a simplified galaxy model created with my friends and the help of our supervisor for the summer project.
The code used the leap-frog method to calculate the velocity and position of the particles after a specific time duration.
The initial condition is set to be a spiral shape, as it is difficult for us to introduce a random initial condition.
